This recitation includes part of assignment 02. 

Now that you have some practice solving recurrences, let's work on implementing some algorithms. In lecture, we discussed a divide and conquer algorithm for integer multiplication. This algorithm takes as input two $n$-bit strings $x = \langle x_L, x_R\rangle$ and $y=\langle y_L, y_R\rangle$ and computes the product $xy$ by using the fact that $xy = 2^{n/2}x_Ly_L + 2^{n/2}(x_Ly_R+x_Ry_L) + x_Ry_R.$ Use the `main.py` to implement one algorithm for integer multiplication: a divide and conquer algorithm that runs in quadratic time. Please refer to Eqs (15) and (16) https://nbviewer.org/github/allan-tulane/cmps2200-slides/blob/main/module-02-recurrences/recurrences.ipynb
